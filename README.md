Before we start coding we draw our architecture to make a plan for writing our code step by step .   

## **Architecture and Data FLow**  

![](./public/assets/arch.jpeg)  

:scroll: First we choose a list of words called *Archaic*  words- the words that are ancient and are no longer in use . we took it from [here](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/archaic-words).  

:bookmark_tabs: Then we start creating the files:  

:open_file_folder: **public** : That includes the `index.html` [with all the html code and links to the other files in the public], `style.css` [styling and media query], `dom.js` [js that manipulate the dom]  
:open_file_folder: **src** : That includes `handler.js`[functions we used in the router], `router.js`[that responds by endpoints], `server.js`[our listener], and the `word.txt`[list of the words].  
:open_file_folder: **test** : That includes `test.js` [file that tests working functions].

Then before the code it-self we wrote some tests using TDD - Test Driven Development - to be sure that our functions are working ‚òëÔ∏è.
To run these tests we add Tape to our project by installing it in the terminal üíª .

:bookmark_tabs: Then we coded our `server` that listens to our `router`, then we write the functions in the router that takes the request and response, to see our public code on the port with the suitable endpoints .  

:muscle: It was very challenging because we have been exposed to these materials just for day and a half, we couldn't put all the pieces together, but we tried our best to learn through coding this app.

If we had more time we surely would finish the app untill the end till the last detail , and try new things we haven't learn even like `xmlhttprequest`. :no_good:
